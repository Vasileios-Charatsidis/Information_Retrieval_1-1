## Description

Code for the [Information Retrieval](http://coursecatalogue.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2016-2017-en/search-course/course/25718) course of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

### Lab 1 - Evaluation Measures, Interleaving and Click Models

<p align="justify">
Studying whether offline evaluation and online evaluation outcomes agree with each other. Constructing simulations using several click models we study the degree of agreement between offline evaluation measures.
